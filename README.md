Nurcara Project aims to integrate and manege resources and knowledge from medieval age.

Nurcara consist of a dataset composed of textual latin documents from medieval age able to describe 
the historical context between 11th and 15th centuries related to the area of Monteleone Rocca Doria in Sardinia 
(Sassari, Italy). 

Starting from a SQL database,using D2RQ framework, our solution focuses on the development of a semantic 
framework  able both to map automatically on the fly in CIDOC-CRM ontology the relational dataset and aggregate the 
knowledge from different repositories or endpoint. This method aims to enrich semantically Nurcaraâ€™s dataset with the external 
resources from the same domain such as SPARQL-endpoint and Linked Data resources.
